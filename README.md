# For The Bit

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Programmatically mining and analyzing my `fitbit` data

This series of **Jupyter Notebooks** serves as a demonstration of how to programmatically fetch and analyze all of your `fitbit` data.  The code isn't perfect, but it should be a good start for folks who know Python and some pandas.  Once you get the data into json or csv format (Chapter 1), it should be straight-forward to adapt the rest of the tutorial to a programming language of your choice.

The rest of the chapters are still under development as a mere passion project. The permissive MIT license means that you are free to use any of this code for your personal projects to mine your own `fitbit` data.  I hope you will-- please share your graphs! :bar_chart: :smile:
